# 🌍 Carbon-Footprint: Earth Day 2025 ML Challenge

**Carbon Footprint Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques**

---

## 🏆 Competition Info

This project was developed for the **HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: Earth Day 2025**.  
🌱 **Goal:** Predict the **carbon footprint** based on behavioral and demographic inputs.  
🏅 **Rank Achieved:** **88th in India**

## 🔍 Problem Overview

Reducing our environmental impact starts with awareness. In this challenge, we were tasked with building an ML model to **estimate individuals' carbon footprints** given their lifestyle patterns. From transportation habits to energy use and diet, the model had to learn from diverse data and generalize well to unseen behavior patterns.

## 🧠 Approach Summary

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Null imputation  
  - Label encoding + One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables  
  - Outlier handling and normalization

- **Modeling Techniques:**  
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)  
  - Ensemble strategy exploration  
  - Feature importance analysis

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Root Mean Sqaured Error (RMSE)  
  - Cross-validation to avoid overfitting
